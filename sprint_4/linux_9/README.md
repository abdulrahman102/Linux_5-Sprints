#### **1. Compress a file by compress, gzip, zip commands and decompress it again. State the differences between compress and gzip commands.**  


|   |  **compress** | **gzip**  |
|  :------------: | :------------: | :------------: |
| **Size**  |  produces a bigger size compared to gzip as it uses old compressing technique  |  produces a smaller size compared to compress command as it uses modern compressing technique |
| **Multiple files**  |can not compress multiple file into 1 file   | can compress multiple file into 1 file  |
|  **File extension** | extension of file is .Z  | extension of file is .gz    |
|  **Speed** | slower than gzip  | faster than compress command  |
|  **Capability** | can uncompress only .Z extension   |can uncompress .gz and .Z extension   |
